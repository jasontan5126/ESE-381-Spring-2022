# ESE-381-Spring-2022

* Labs done in Embedded C and the target microcontroller to be used is the AVR Curiosity Nano 128DB48.

* Description: A continuation of ESE 380 which used AVR Assembly. The entire system design cycle, including requirements definition and system specifications, is covered. Topics include real-time requirements, timing, interrupt driven systems, analog data conversion, multi-module and multi-language systems. The interface between high-level language and assembly language is covered. A complete system is designed and prototyped in the laboratory.
